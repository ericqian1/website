  Hello! I hope you are doing well and find yourself on this website willingly. 
  My name is Eric and I am now a 20-something-year-old data scientist and engineer. 
  I did my undergrad at the University of Texas at Austin where I majored in Petroleum Engineering and Economics.
  From there, I began my career bridging the gap between data analytics and traditional engineering. 
  I codified, functionalized, and implemented several engineering problems as more-modern digital products based in analytics.
  The power of data science in modernizing the energy industry, my curiosity and love for problem solving, and a general thirst to learn more
  spurred me to go deeper in the subject. I began my Master's in Data Science at Georgia Tech and made a career change to a Series-C remote sensing
  startup where I learned a ton about proper software engineering, big data engineering, and algorithms. Today, I have made a return to the energy
  industry to be a leader in digital transformation, analytics, and decarbonization of the energy industry. 
  Outside of work, I have a penchant for music and enjoy practicing the guitar, violin, and piano. I also mess around with producing
  music and making mixes. I also have a deep interest in statistics. I enjoy playing poker and investing in different equities.
